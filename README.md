# EGameEngine
My take on creating a game engine similar to Unity.

To use this game engine, please refer to my current SkyClimberGame that I personally created as an example. Future example will soon come.    

Available Games  
-Skyclimber: player is jumping on platforms to reach the highest height possible  

[]Physics [Will be developed alongside example games that I wish to develop]    
-[]Center of gravity  
-[]Friction  
-[]Momentum  
-[]Tension  
-[]Attraction   

Version 2.0

[]Custom hitbox creation   
[]Further enhanced collision to handle angled hitbox collision   
[]CODE UPDATE: change variables for certain classes that have extended classes to have protected variables instead of   
private to redunce redundancy of getting certain variables.
