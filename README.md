# EGameEngine
My take on creating a game engine similar to Unity.

To use this game engine, please refer to my current SkyClimberGame that I personally created as an example. Future example will soon come.

[X]Sprite Creation  
[X]Sprite Hitbox Collision   
[X]Sprite Hitbox Intersection

[X]EMap/EPixel generation  
[X]Current Score  
[X]Example game - SkyClimber  
[]Redo alg for generateX & Y platforms --> Bug:Platform generates outside of eMap, which equals character falling out of map
-[]look for better random number generator
