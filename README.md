# EGameEngine
My take on creating a game engine similar to Unity.

To use this game engine, please refer to my current SkyClimberGame that I personally created as an example. Future example will soon come.    

Version 1.0  
-Gravity physics 
-Sprite Hitbox Collision 
-Sprite Hitbox Intersection 
-EMap/EPixel generation 
-Example game - SkyClimber 

Version 2.0 
-Sprite hitbox emulator on my website  
-Custom hitbox creation  
-Further enhanced collision to handle angled hitbox collision
